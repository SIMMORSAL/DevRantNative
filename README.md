# DevRant Native

 A devRant demo made natively for android by a native of devRant.

### Key Differences

* Animations everywhere.
* Saving you 1 to 10 seconds (depending on internet connectivity) from waiting to read the rest of a rant
in feed, finished with "... \[Read More\]", by loading it instantly.
* Loading Gifs inside feed.
* No blue color, so no eye strain reading at nighttime.
* Sick loading animation.
* Nowhere near being finished.


### License

None.
